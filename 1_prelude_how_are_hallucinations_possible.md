# 1. Prelude: How Are Hallucinations Possible?

## 1. THE BRAIN IN THE VAT

Starts with the classic thought experiment of the brain in a vat. What if we are just a brain in a vat, under life support, with scientists trickering us into thinking that we are more than that? Although simulating our whole environment through nerve impulses in the right places is **possible in principle**, it is **impossible in fact**: I feel my environment, I decide to act on my body, and when, for example, my position changes, the feels I get from the environment change as well. There would be an endless amount of computation needed to simulate all these feels, changes in the environment, etc, and this combinatorial explosion of possibilities would make the problem intractable.

Basically we can conclude that that we are not brains in vats. And we can conclude as well that strong hallucinations should be impossible, for the same reasons.

### Notes

That seems to me like a pretty weak argument against the brain in a vat theory. The scientists tinkering with our brain could be tricking us, not only by providing us with fake perceptions of the world, but also by making our brain think that the changes we cause in our environment make sense when they actually do not. In this way there would be no need for such infinite number of calculations. I think this reasoning makes more sense after reading the part 3 of this chapter.

## 2. PRANKSTERS IN THE BRAIN

How do hallucinations happen? Is the brain responsible of elaborating and playing the whole story? Is it due to some "noise" or malfunctioning at a more physical level, ie. at a nerve level, which translates into a fake perception? This last hypothesis seems plausible, but these kind of noise should produce only very weak hallucinations.

Do, then, strong hallucinations ever occur at all? There seems to be an inverse correlation between strength and frequency. However there is another interesting pattern, which is the victim's report on her unusual passivity in the face of the extravagances or incongruencies of the hallucination.

Strong hallucinations can survive because the "illusionist" can count on a particular line of exploration by the victim, and therefore can only prepare the illusion to be sustained "in the directions that the victim will look". This connection between the illusionist and the victim makes it possible for the illusionist to build an hallucination which anticipates the exploratory intentions and decisions of the victim. In absence of this ability to "read the victim's mind", the illusionist would still be able to sustain the hallucination by "forcing" the victim to make her inquiries in a particular direction.

There is, however, a more economical (and realistic) way in which hallucinations can be produced, which can be understood by analogy with a party game.

## 3. A PARTY GAME CALLED PSYCHOANALYSIS

A group of people stands in a room, and one of them (the dupe), is told that while he stays away, one of the others will be called upon to relate a recent dream. Once all know a dream, the dupe will come in, and start asking questions to figure out what the dream was. The other members, however, will answer *yes* or *no* following two rules:

1. If the last letter of the question belongs to the first half of the alphabet, they'll answer *yes*, otherwise they'll answer *no*.
2. They will not contradict previously answered questions.

In this way, the dupe creates a narrative without actually noticing. But in another sense, this dream has no author. It is an illusion with no illusionist. This has a lot of resemblance with a family of well-regarded models of perceptual systems. For example, it is held that human vision cannot be explained as entirely "data-driven" or "bottom-up", but needs to be supplemented by a few "expectation-driven" rounds of hypothesis testing. Another member of the family is the "analysis by synthesis" model of perception, which supposes that perceptions are built up in a process that weaves back and forth between centrally generated expectations, on the one hand, and confirmations or dis-confirmations arising from the periphery on the other hand. After a first "pre-processing" has occurred in the peripheral layers, the tasks of perception are completed by rounds of "generate-and-test" cycles, in which one's expectations and interests shape hypothesis which the perceptual system must confirm or dis-confirm. A rapid sequence of these hypothesis and confirmations lead to the final product, an updated model of the world of the perceiver.

These generate-and-test theories of perception support a simple and powerful model of hallucination. If the hypothesis-generation side works well but the data-driven side goes into a disordered or random round of confirmation and dis-confirmation, and the noise is amplified into wrong confirmations and dis-confirmations (like the yes and no answers before), the current expectations, obsessions or worries of the victim will lead to framing hypotheses whose content will reflect those interests. A story unfolds in the perceptual system without an actual author: the illusionist goes into an arbitrary confirmation mode, and the victim provides the content by asking the questions.

This explains the link between the emotional state of the hallucinator and the content of the hallucinations. It would explain as well why often hallucinations often result from sensory deprivation: maybe in these cases the data-driven side of the hypothesis-generation-and-test system lowers its threshold for noise, which gets amplified leading to arbitrary patterns of confirmation and dis-confirmations.

Hallucination-causing drugs could act by raising, lowering or disordering a confirmation threshold.

This model can as well explain the generation of dreams. Unlike in the party game, here there is no non-contradiction rule, as we often notice from the changing nature of dreams.

A central idea: the key element in our explanations about how dreams and hallucinations are possible at all was the fact that the only work the brain must do is whatever it takes to *assuage epistemic hunger* (satisfy curiosity). If the "victim" is passive or incurious about topic X, then no material about topic X needs to be prepared.
