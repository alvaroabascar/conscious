# Notes on **Consciousness Explained**, *by Daniel C. Dennet*.

This repository contains personal notes on **Consciousness Explained**, by *Daniel C. Dennet*. These are mainly a summary of each chapter, done for personal use with the only intention of helping me understand each chapter. These notes contain both paraphrasing and direct quotes from the book, since I tend to take them while reading. Rephrasing, personal views and direct quotes are mixed, and I have not attempted to indicate which sentences come directly from the book.
